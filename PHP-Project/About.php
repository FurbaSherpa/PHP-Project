    This Project is created by Robert Magyari and Furba Sherpa. We are currently students in our second year at George Brown College in the
    T127 Pathway. This project was developed for our COMP 1230 class.

<h3>Misson Statement</h3>
<p style="font-size:115%">
    Our goal is to provide textbooks to students that otherwise would not be able to afford it. We realize not everyone can afford to purchase
    every textbook needed for each class. By making these textbooks free for the students to use we believe it will better the education for
    many students.
