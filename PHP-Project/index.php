<h3>Why we created</h3>
<p>
   Welcome to our Website! We created this project for our COMP 1230 class. This project is for students who are struggling financially and need some support to get textbooks for courses
   within the Computer Technology department of George Brown College.
</p>


<h3>What the site offers</h3>
<p>
    On our site, outside of the homepage there is four webpages. We have a page called "School Items" Where you can browse Textbooks for courses you might need, we have a Rules page where you can read the rules
    of the site, we have an about page with information on the websites developers and our mission statement, and lastly we have a contact page where you can get in contact with services to rent the textbook 
    you need.
